6.1 Write a query to return a list of all the films rented by PETER MENARD showing the most recent first

Solution:

This exercises involves quite a few joins but once that's setup it's just a matter of filtering for the right customer and ordering by the rental date.

select r.rental_date, f.title
from rental as r
  inner join customer as c
    on r.customer_id = c.customer_id
  inner join inventory as i
    on r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id
  inner join film as f
    on i.film_id = f.film_id
where c.first_name = 'PETER'
  and c.last_name = 'MENARD'
order by r.rental_date desc;
