4.1 Write a query to return the total count of customers in the customer table and the count of how many customers provided an email address

Solution:

SELECT COUNT(*) will return the total number of rows, while COUNT(expression) will return the number of rows where expression is not NULL.

select
  count(*) as "# customers",
  count(email) as "# customers with email"
from customer;



4.2 Building on the previous exercise, now return an additional result showing the percentage of customers with an email address (as a helpful hint, if you're getting 0 try multiplying the fraction by 100.0 - we'll examine why this is necessary in an upcoming chapter on data types)

Solution:

You can obtain the percentage by dividing the two terms and multiplying by 100.0

select
  count(*) as "# customers",
  count(email) as "# customers with email",
  100.0 * count(email) / count(*) as "% with email"
from customer;



4.3 Write a query to return the number of distinct customers who have made payments

Solution:

You can use DISTINCT inside the COUNT function to count the number of distinct customer IDs.

select count(distinct customer_id)
from payment;



4.4 What is the average length of time films are rented out for

Solution:

select avg(return_date - rental_date) as "avg rental duration"
from rental;



4.5 Write a query to return the sum total of all payment amounts received

Solution:

select sum(amount) as total
from payment;
