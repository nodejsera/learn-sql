5.1 Write a query to print a description of each film's length as shown in the output below. When a film does not have a length, print: [title] is unknown length

Solution:

There are a couple of different ways you could accomplish this. The coalesce function is a popular way to substitute in a default value when some expression is NULL (in this case, if the length is NULL, the entire expression length || ' minutes' will evaluate to NULL).

select
  title || ' is ' || coalesce(length || ' minutes', 'unknown length') as length_desc 
from film;



5.2 You want to play a movie title guessing game with some friends. Write a query to print only the first 3 letters of each film title and then '*' for the rest (The repeat function may come in handy here...)

Solution:

You can first use the left function to obtain the first 3 characters of the film title, and then concatenate that with '*' repeated (length - 3) times to fill out the remaining characters in the title.

select left(title, 3) || repeat('*', length(title) - 3) as "Guess!"
from film;
